"Aloha!" That was the first word I heard from Howard Rheingold as our classroom-projected Skype screen lit up, revealing the social media expert in all his silver-mustachioed, multi-colored-shirt glory. Wearing a brightly polka-dotted button-up T-shirt that resembled a repurposed Jackson Pollock canvas, Rheingold—through the power of networked digital media—stood before us, simultaneously located in our Duke21C classroom in Durham, North Carolina, and outside his Northern California home. On this mild, late-winter afternoon, the man who coined the phrase "virtual community" generously devoted a part of his day to talk with us about the personal and social skills one needs to excel in this digitally webbed world. A nearby fountain gently trickled as he donned his Panama hat and sat down on a sturdy wooden chair in his backyard garden, initiating us into that rare group of honorees who have been invited into the shade of the sanctum sanctorum called Howard's Plum Tree.
