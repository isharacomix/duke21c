> —— Howard Rheingold, Net Smart: How to Thrive Online

 

"Aloha!" That was the first word I heard from Howard Rheingold as our classroom-projected Skype screen lit up, revealing the social media expert in all his silver-mustachioed, multi-colored-shirt glory. Wearing a brightly polka-dotted button-up T-shirt that resembled a repurposed Jackson Pollock canvas, Rheingold—through the power of networked digital media—stood before us, simultaneously located in our Duke21C classroom in Durham, North Carolina, and outside his Northern California home. On this mild, late-winter afternoon, the man who coined the phrase "virtual community" generously devoted a part of his day to talk with us about the personal and social skills one needs to excel in this digitally webbed world. A nearby fountain gently trickled as he donned his Panama hat and sat down on a sturdy wooden chair in his backyard garden, initiating us into that rare group of honorees who have been invited into the shade of the sanctum sanctorum called Howard's Plum Tree.

It was quite fitting to interview Rheingold underneath his plum tree because this is where he conversed with digital specialists—such as MIT Media Lab Director Joi Ito and 1990s Microsoft Virtual Worlds Group Director Linda Stone—to write the very book we were discussing with him: Net Smart: How to Thrive Online (which, not surprisingly, he wrote under his plum tree). A lecturer on virtual communities, social media, and digital journalism at Stanford University and UC Berkeley, Rheingold has been exploring and writing about digital environments for over thirty years, writing such books as Tools for Thought: The History and Future of Mind-Expanding Technology, The Virtual Community: Homesteading on the Electronic Frontier, and Smart Mobs: The Next Social Revolution. His book Net Smart introduces readers to the skills, habits, and modes of thinking one needs in order to participate and make full use of the virtually infinite possibilities afforded by the Internet. Rheingold believes that "we can all benefit from adopting some of the rules of thumb discovered by mindful digital media users" (4). He calls these digital "rules of thumb" skills, or literacies, although he admits that "solitary skills are not enough today. Literacy now means skill plus social competency in using that skill collaboratively" (4). Within the World Wide Web's architecture of participation, digital literacies are both solitary and social because any single act ramifies outward to affect nearly anyone with Internet access. "We live in a world in which you can get the answer to any question within seconds," Rheingold told us over Skype, "but it's up to you to determine the validity of the information you receive. It's so important for learners to understand that critical thinking is not just a tool in the toolkit that you can pull out on occasion, but an attitude towards seeing information that you swim in." In other words, a digital literacy can be seen as a mental framework one develops through practice—a simultaneously personal and collaborative skill that one must constantly hone in the midst of our computer-mediated lives.

"Every two days," writes Rheingold, "humans produce as much information as we did from the era of cave paintings up to 2003" (98-99). Swimming in this ubiquitous, always-on digital data, the average American "consumes thirty-four gigabytes of information on an average day" (Rheingold 99). In 2007 alone, YouTube singlehandedly devoured more bandwidth than the entire Internet did back in 2000 (Thomas and Seely Brown 41). All this information means that the Internet provides powerful tools for learning, such as online games, YouTube, and Wikipedia, creating a classroom that is all-pervasive and always accessible—what Douglas Thomas and John Seely Brown call the "new culture of learning" (17). As Thomas and Seely Brown elaborate, the Internet connects individual intellectual pursuits with a virtually limitless number of networks and collectives, which means that learning "driven by passion and play is poised to significantly alter and extend our ability to think, innovate, and discover in ways that have not previously been possible," allowing us to "ask questions that have never before been imaginable" (Thomas and Seely Brown 89). But this digital ubiquity also means that, without the essential skills to navigate this flood of data, it's easy to digitally drown as our lives become swamped in endless information. Without basic digital literacies, this new culture of learning also becomes engulfed in a digital deluge, and we become so occupied treading the water of our digital in-flow that we don't have time to ask these innovative questions. Without digital literacies, manipulation becomes the norm instead of empowerment; we become mere consumers as opposed to creative citizens; and, as Rheingold asserts, without digital literacies, our lives revolve around searching and finding instead of learning and knowing (18, 86). Even worse is when individuals shut off the digital flow altogether because, although you may have eliminated some distractions, you've also eliminated opportunities (Rheingold 41). "The free flows of information that digital technologies have made possible are enriching if used properly," writes Rheingold, "but unhealthy for us as individuals, unproductive for businesses, and toxic for our societies if we don't know how to take them in […], evaluate and assimilate them, and contribute our own participation or collaboration" (5). Without digital literacies, the thoughts, innovations, and discoveries promised by the new culture of learning become narrower, less frequent, and dissipated—an atrophied version of its potential self.

Considering how beneficial it is to practice and share the essentials of social media know-how, as a class we decided to read Net Smart and talk with Howard Rheingold in order to use our knowledge of digital literacies to create a foundation for our research into 21st century pedagogies. In many ways, Net Smart seemed like the logical next step after reading Thomas and Seely Brown's A New Culture of Learning: Cultivating the Imagination for a World of Constant Change, encouraging fruitful intertextual conversations when these two texts are directly juxtaposed. In their book, Thomas and Seely Brown characterize this new culture of learning as a classroom freed of geographic restraints—where learning happens wherever one has a connection to the Internet. Often, they define this new culture of learning within the 21st century classroom by contrasting it with characteristics of the 20th century classroom. For example, if the 20th century classroom frames knowledge as a passively shared commodity that changes slowly through time, then the 21st century classroom represents knowledge as an actively shared process that is dynamically changing (98). Twentieth century knowledge is a what; 21st century knowledge is a where (91). Thus, in the 21st century classroom, rather than necessarily progressing out of interpretation ("what something means"), meaning more often progresses out of contextualization ("where something has meaning") (Thomas and Seely Brown 95). When information becomes a where and not a what, the practice of critically thinking about this information—that is, of practicing digital literacies—becomes all the more crucial because it is now, to a greater extent, up to you to arbitrate not only if this information is reliable, but also if it is worth your time.<sup>1</sup> Although Thomas and Seely Brown rightly point out how imagination and play are methods to make sense of the digital flood of information, there are also some fundamental, learnable skills that one needs to reach that playful point, and it is these skills which constitute digital literacies. With digital literacies, the Internet transforms from a space of distraction and information overload into a space of mental-augmentation. With regard to how the 21st century classroom relates to knowledge in a different way, seeing knowledge as a place to imaginatively express and develop passions (i.e. a learning community), rather than a mere collection of facts and figures (i.e. an information warehouse), digital literacies represent the essential skills that allow this new culture of learning to thrive, conveying that initial empowering perception of agency. Even though one could directly teach digital literacies in the classroom as a course in itself, I was particularly interested in exploring ways of incorporating digital literacies into the structure of the classroom such that they could be introduced within most any educational discipline. With this integrated approach in mind, I'd like to briefly describe Rheingold's fundamental digital literacies, and then focus on the ways he assimilates them into the classroom, exploring implications and alternative examples as they arise. This chapter integrates Rheingold's essential digital literacies into the classroom, taking these words of web wisdom as a whole and suggesting pedagogical points of departure.

 

Digital Literacies

In his book, Howard Rheingold delineates five fundamental digital literacies, or "expressive and interpretive skills with a social element, grounded in a shared context": the digital literacies of attention, critical consumption of information (aka "crap detection"), participation, collaboration, and network smarts (252).<sup>2</sup> It would take an entire book to adequately explain these literacies (indeed, it is a book: Net Smart), and since my goal is to provide some worked examples of how one might integrate some of these literacies into the classroom, I'd like to briefly define each of the five literacies before diving into the classroom.

As Howard writes, your most fundamental technological affordance is your own attention (9). Trying to be mindful on the web before you've practiced mindfulness in your own life is like trying to outrun 2012 Olympian Usain "Lightning" Bolt before you've learned how to walk. It doesn't work, which is why the digital literacy of attention focuses on ways to cultivate mindfulness. Dipping into a pop-science version of modern neuroscience, Rheingold invokes neuroscientist Carla Shatz's apothegm—"neurons that fire together wire together"—in order to show that simply aiming your awareness at your breath (i.e. spending a little time each day counting your exhalations) allows you to transform your breath into a tool for mindfulness (72). That is, you can begin to practice the digital literacy of attention simply by noticing your attention: intention leads to attention. "Attention connects the events that occur simultaneously in the mind, between people, and among technologies," writes Howard. "Human thought processes are themselves no more than a part—a kind of focusing lens—of a system that includes neurons, symbols, search engines, social systems, and computational clouds" (33).

The next digital literacy—critical consumption of information—moves up by one order of complexity by thinking about awareness in relation to how your technologies can be used to augment your attention and, when immersed in the digital web, how you differentiate the cream from the crud. Rheingold points out that "crap detection" can be as simple as searching for the author's name on a webpage or triangulating the credibility of a breaking-news story from Twitter.<sup>3</sup> Best of all, you can have your computer work for you even when you're away by making use of the available filters, dashboards, and news radars, creating a melding of mind and machine that Rheingold refers to as "infotension" (97).
