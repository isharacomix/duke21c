Appendix One: The Mozilla Manifesto
=================================
Introduction
------------
The Internet is becoming an increasingly important part of our lives. The Mozilla project is a global community of people who believe that openness, innovation, and opportunity are key to the continued health of the Internet. We have worked together since 1998 to ensure that the Internet is developed in a way that benefits everyone. We are best known for creating the Mozilla Firefox web browser.

The Mozilla project uses a community-based approach to create world-class open source software and to develop new types of collaborative activities. We create communities of people involved in making the Internet experience better for all of us.

As a result of these efforts, we have distilled a set of principles that we believe are critical for the Internet to continue to benefit the public good as well as commercial aspects of life. We set out these principles below.

The goals for the Manifesto are to:
-----------------------------------
 * articulate a vision for the Internet that Mozilla participants want the Mozilla Foundation to pursue;
 * speak to people whether or not they have a technical background;
 * make Mozilla contributors proud of what we're doing and motivate us to continue; and
 * provide a framework for other people to advance this vision of the Internet.

These principles will not come to life on their own. People are needed to make the Internet open and participatory—people acting as individuals, working together in groups, and leading others. The Mozilla Foundation is committed to advancing the principles set out in the Mozilla Manifesto. We invite others to join us and make the Internet an ever better place for everyone.
Principles

 * The Internet is an integral part of modern life–a key component in education, communication, collaboration, business, entertainment and society as a whole.
 * The Internet is a global public resource that must remain open and accessible.
 * The Internet should enrich the lives of individual human beings.
 * Individuals' security on the Internet is fundamental and cannot be treated as optional.
 * Individuals must have the ability to shape their own experiences on the Internet.
 * The effectiveness of the Internet as a public resource depends upon interoperability (protocols, data formats, content), innovation and decentralized participation worldwide.
 * Free and open source software promotes the development of the Internet as a public resource.
 * Transparent community-based processes promote participation, accountability, and trust.
 * Commercial involvement in the development of the Internet brings many benefits; a balance between commercial goals and public benefit is critical.
 * Magnifying the public benefit aspects of the Internet is an important goal, worthy of time, attention and commitment.

Advancing the Mozilla Manifesto
-------------------------------
There are many different ways of advancing the principles of the Mozilla Manifesto. We welcome a broad range of activities, and anticipate the same creativity that Mozilla participants have shown in other areas of the project. For individuals not deeply involved in the Mozilla project, one basic and very effective way to support the Manifesto is to use Mozilla Firefox and other products that embody the principles of the Manifesto.

Mozilla Foundation Pledge
-------------------------
The Mozilla Foundation pledges to support the Mozilla Manifesto in its activities. Specifically, we will:

 * build and enable open source technologies and communities that support the Manifesto's principles;
 * build and deliver great consumer products that support the Manifesto's principles;
 * use the Mozilla assets (intellectual property such as copyrights and trademarks, infrastructure, funds, and reputation) to keep the Internet an open platform;
 * promote models for creating economic value for the public benefit; and
 * promote the Mozilla Manifesto principles in public discourse and within the Internet industry.

Some Foundation activities–currently the creation, delivery and promotion of consumer products–are conducted primarily through the Mozilla Foundation's wholly owned subsidiary, the Mozilla Corporation.

Invitation
----------
The Mozilla Foundation invites all others who support the principles of the Mozilla Manifesto to join with us, and to find new ways to make this vision of the Internet a reality.

Appendix Three: (Mostly) Digital Tool Kit for Open Peer Teaching and Learning
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are at least two important pedagogical motivations for open peer teaching and learning. First, open learning creates an atmosphere of mutual learning, contribution, and collaboration that not only enhances our engagement in the quality and content of the learning experience but also provides a life skill for future interactions—in the workplace, in everyday life, in the community at large. Second, open peer teaching and learning takes advantage of the affordances of digital tools available at a given moment, giving participants hands-on experience in using these tools and also a practical and theoretical lesson in the possibilities, limitations, challenges, and even potential risks of open, public, online communication and interaction. As such, open learning uses a digital toolkit and is constantly reflective about the tools, a meditation-in-action about the tools themselves and all the attendant issues the tools give rise to.

In our 21st Century Literacies class, we used an array of tools, some of them open source, some proprietary, almost all of them currently (and we stress "currently") available to the public for free. We decided not to invest in an expensive ePortfolio system since we found available tools that worked quite brilliantly for us. We list them here because they proved useful to us and may well prove so to others. We hope you will add to the list, and indicate what digital tools best serve your own open peer teaching and learning goals. We also hope future users will update our list with whatever new comes along in future years.

Wordpress
---------
Our entire class website was built on a Wordpress site supported by our host institution, Duke University, and housed on the Duke server. You can visit our original site here: [http://sites.duke.edu/english890s_01_s2013/](http://sites.duke.edu/english890s_01_s2013/). We chose a theme, set up the original syllabus and structuring principles for the course on the site, and then gave every class member editing privileges so new tabs, topics, and other affordances could be added over the course of the semester. We also set some settings as "public" so that anyone could learn along with us, and other settings as "private" so that only those registered in the course could see the content. Important: For public blogs, students had the choice of blogging under their own name or under a pseudonym. For FERPA rules on student privacy on public sites, please see this essential blog post: [http://hastac.org/blogs/superadmin/2012/11/30/guidelines-public-student-class-blogs-ethics-legalities-ferp](http://hastac.org/blogs/superadmin/2012/11/30/guidelines-public-student-class-blogs-ethics-legalities-ferp).   

lynda.com
---------
Wordpress is relatively easy to use but not always intuitive. lynda.com is a great online learning resource and includes many videos about how to build a Wordpress site: [http://www.lynda.com/WordPress-training-tutorials/330-0.html](http://www.lynda.com/WordPress-training-tutorials/330-0.html).

Sakai
-----
We did not use Duke's Sakai site very often but occasionally we did for communication purposes (it has a useful email tool) and for posting those few book chapters that were not available online from legal sources. Sakai negotiates agreements for "fair use" for limited size groups (we had only eight students in our class).

Books
-----
Are books a "digital tool"? Good question. We had four or five books that we all read together and some of us preferred to purchase physical books, others read on Kindles or other devices. When we read McLuhan, we used a reprint of the original so that we could see the physical layout, the artistry of the text, the artifact itself. Our most technologically proficient users were also our most dedicated book-readers. Given all the digital parts of book production, it is important to remember and think about books as a "digital tool" as well.

hastac.org Group
----------------
The Humanities, Arts, Science, and Technology Alliance and Collaboratory (HASTAC or "haystack") is an 11,000+ network and user community that charges no dues, supports no advertising, and does not sell its data. Cathy N. Davidson is one of HASTAC's co-founders and she is its principal administrator (with a central administering team located at Duke University). Any HASTAC network member can create a group on HASTAC for a class, a topic, or internal and external communications, and can use all the functionality of the site plus link to its large network membership. Class members created a number of Groups on the site and we will soon be sponsoring an open Group on the "History and Future of Higher Education" in which this text will be hosted as an open, free textbook that others can use and remix.

Google Drive, Google Docs
-------------------------
Google Docs allow for collaborative, synchronous, and asynchronous writing and editing. This entire book was written on Google Docs. Lots of them. We also took real-time notes (editing one another's typos, adding content one person may have missed, and so forth) during class discussions, some of which became the basis for chapters. We made some of the Google Docs open for viewing by the public, some open for editing by the public, and some private, just for sharing within our group.

Qualtrics
---------
At several points, to get the "temperature read" on the class, we created surveys using a Qualtrics site offered by Duke University. It was a quick and easy way to see ideas, differences, contributions, opinions, and attitudes.

Twitter
-------
Using the Twitter hashtag #Duke21C, we communicated with one another and the larger public, often tweeting out updates on our discussions, requests for information, or invitations to participate. Twitter brought many visitors to our open public sites and sometimes with surprising results. For instance, the image that opens Chapter Two was shared by Giulia Forsythe.

Facebook
--------
Although we did not create a Facebook group specifically for our course, we used this social media platform to solicit collaborators and to inform a larger public about events we were hosting, online and in real time.

Skype
-----
We used this online telecommunications tool for real-time, face-to-face distance conversations with a number of visitors and, occasionally, with class members who could not be physically present for our meetings.

Projector
---------
We had the luxury of being able to project from a laptop to a larger screen that all could view. We did this almost every class, including projecting the Google Doc that we would then each edit on our laptops.

Laptops
-------
We all came to class with laptops, a luxury that not everyone can afford. It is important, given the issues of digital divide, digital inclusion, and digital exclusion, to note the cost here. For collaborative online teaching, laptops proved far more useful than iPads and other tablet devices that are configured to be far better for downloading than uploading and co-creating content. Also, one member of our group—significantly the finest programmer in the course— proudly (even lovingly) has the same PC laptop on which he learned to code in high school, and has constantly upgraded it over the years. We mention that here because it is not necessary to have the shiniest, newest, most expensive computer for open learning and teaching. What is important is to have the most open system possible.

Space
-----
We thought we would have our class meetings in the new PhD Lab in Digital Knowledge but, at the last moment, the construction of a dedicated space for that Lab had to be cancelled for financial reasons. Again, it is important to realize that technology is social—it is not about machines, but about humans wanting to work together. We held our class in a standard, old-fashioned classroom whose one affordance was a flat-screen projector and a cabinet in which we could lock the remote and other devices for protection and safety. We could have done what we did without the flat screen, although it certainly enhanced our work together.

Time
----
We had to fight against the university calendar to schedule the class as one three-hour weekly slot. Institutions are not yet designed for collaborative open learning. The longer period is necessary for setting up and not wasting time each session doing so. Also, because our class was made up of students from Duke University, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and North Carolina State University, meeting once a week allowed greater convenience for those traveling half an hour or more.

Food and Refreshments
---------------------
Because we met over the dinner hour and because three hours is a long time, we tried to provide refreshments (including wine sometimes, since all class members were over 21) and even a light dinner for each class. Technology is social. That also means bodies.    

 
Appendix Four: Useful Sample Documents for Open Peer Teaching and Learning
==========================================================================

Several different kinds of documents proved useful in helping to shape our collaboration and this experiment in open peer teaching and learning. We offer these here as samples for you to remix for your own purposes.
